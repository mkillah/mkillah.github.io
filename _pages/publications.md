> Eye-tracking study - **The effect of reverse perspective and player's rating on flexible thinking in
chess**. Suvremena Psihologija, 22(1), 53-65. doi:10.21465/2019-SP-221-04

I investigated mental rigidity in chess expertise named Einstellung effect and potential approaches to overcome it. 
The effect is evident in situations where  players struggle to optimize tactics when a familiar solution is available,
usually decide to make suboptimal and familiar solution instead of optimal and less familiar solution. I have learned 
that presenting positions from a different, reversed, viewpoint does not reduce E-effect and more experienced players 
were more likely to find optimal solutions, with player rating having the strongest effect on flexible thinking in chess.

> **Do higher-level chess players rely on heuristics in general as well as in chess problem solving?**
In book: Proceedings of the XXVIII Scientific Conference Empirical Studies in Psychology.

Philosophy, University of Belgrade

This study explores the intuitive and heuristic methods 
employed by chess experts, comparing their problem-solving abilities within and outside their domain of expertise. 
The study found that greater expertise in chess correlates with
increased efficiency in chess-related tasks but does not necessarily translate to improved performance in general 
problem-solving tasks. Interestingly, participants who excelled in chess-specific tasks tended to be less accurate
in general problem-solving tasks, indicating a potential transfer of cognitive style that may not always be advantageous.
